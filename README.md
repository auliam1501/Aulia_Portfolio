The purpose of this project is analyze customer behavior to increase Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) . The variables that affect to increasing GMV are customer acquisition quantity, Average Order Value (AOV), and Purchased Frequency. To know which customer give more effect to increasing GMV, we conduct customer segmentation analysis using K-means cluster and RFM method. The result of the analysis are frequency of purchased of low-value customer give highest impact to GMV

Tools :Spreadsheet, SQL, Python, Tableau
Analysis Method :   k-means cluster, RFM, Linear regression

[Link Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15hJ0x1MJT-J6jf_9fk4NA_F8oTZA4EZJ)

This aim of this project is to predict the stock market with machine learning, a study case for BBRI (Bank Republic Indonesia), one of the big banks in Indonesia. To gather the data, we scraped the data from Yahoo Finance. FB Prophet and LSTM are used to predict the stock price. To compare the goodness of fit of the predicted model, we use MSE and MAE. The result of this project is FB Prophet is better at predicting the stock price than LSTM

Tools : Python with Google Colab
Analysis Method :   FB Prophet, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
